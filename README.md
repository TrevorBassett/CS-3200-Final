# CS-3200-Final
Database for CS 3200 final

# Executive Summary
        	Our projects aim to help any given Baseball Organization effectively search for and evaluate a given player. Our database will include relevant information about individual player statistics such as batting, pitching, and other relevant statistics. Being able to quickly call upon statistics for a player in a given moment will be helpful for teams and organizations to make effective decisions when it comes to potential rosters and line-ups and selecting individual players for a team.
# Introduction
        	The problem at hand for many Baseball Organizations is knowing what players to select and what players to put into a line up. Thereâ€™s a couple of things that we want to keep track of in our database. Games, Teams, Players, Players Statistics. One player can be on one team for a given season. We also want to be able to call upon how specific players performed in specific games. Teams will participate in multiple games throughout the season. Then what is most important to what we are looking for is individual players. We want to look for offensive and defensive statistics.
        	Offensive players will have batting statistics. Statistics for BA, RBI, etc. We also want to be able to identify quality at bats for individuals. Then specifically for defense we will look at just pitchers and their statistics. Batters will face multiple teams and pitchers during the season. Vice Versa, Pitchers will face many teams and batters during the season. Each plate appearance will also be able to be scrutinized with our datasets with what pitcher and what batter is in each event.
        	Our database will give Baseball Organizations valuable tools when it comes to day to day games and when trying to select effective players for their squad. We will be able to find key statistics from a player on any given team. We will also be able to see how a player fairs against a specific team or player.
# Development
  For our development process we are using Prototyping.
A given Baseball Organization wants to be able to quickly procure information about Games, Teams, Players, and those statistics that come with. We have designed the model in a way where we can query for players against specific teams and pitchers so we could help a team decide on line-ups. Then similarly, pitchers against specific teams and players.
We think that a Prototyping approach would be best because when we get the working product in organizations hand, they can a) give us feedback and suggestions and b) monitor the system for performance errors.
We are thinking a given team might be looking for specific things in players and teams so their advice would greatly help us in designing our finished product.
